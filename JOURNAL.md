# Day 1 (June 9th): Familiarize yourself with fusion 360
Today I created an education account for fusion 360 and installed the application as well. In addition to that, I familiarized myself with the program by building a lego brick from an tuturial.

# Day 2 (June 12th): First steps in KiCad
Today I installed KiCad and followed the tutorial from [Hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide). I also decided for the [ESP32-32D](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4000093185394.html?spm=a2g0o.store_pc_home.productList_2007716161325.4000093185394&gatewayAdapt=glo2deu), added the three-pin connector for the servo and I was looking for a screen. However I am still unsure about the measurements of the footprint.

# Day 3 (June 26th): A lot of porgress for the PCB
On day three, I worked a lot. Firstly, I spent some time searching for a good way to implement audio. Then I realised that I didn't need a fancy audio source with an amplifier. I opted for a simple active buzzer. Next, I looked for some buttons and ended up with Hackpad-like keyboard switches to control the box later on. I also did a lot of research on load cells. I will use an HX711 chip for the load cell. Tomorrow, I need to find the exact measurements of the cell for the box. I also created a schematic diagram and moved some parts to the back of the PCB. Tomorrow, I have to wire the PCB and perhaps create the BOM on GitHub. Overall, I am really happy with today's progress.
