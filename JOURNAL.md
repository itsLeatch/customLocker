# Day 1 (June 9th): Familiarize yourself with fusion 360
Today I created an education account for fusion 360 and installed the application as well. In addition to that, I familiarized myself with the program by building a lego brick from an tuturial.

# Day 2 (June 12th): First steps in KiCad
Today I installed KiCad and followed the tutorial from [Hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide). I also decided for the [ESP32-32D](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4000093185394.html?spm=a2g0o.store_pc_home.productList_2007716161325.4000093185394&gatewayAdapt=glo2deu), added the three-pin connector for the servo and I was looking for a screen. However I am still unsure about the measurements of the footprint.

# Day 3 (June 26th): A lot of porgress for the PCB
On day three, I worked a lot. Firstly, I spent some time searching for a good way to implement audio. Then I realised that I didn't need a fancy audio source with an amplifier. I opted for a simple active buzzer. Next, I looked for some buttons and ended up with Hackpad-like keyboard switches to control the box later on. I also did a lot of research on load cells. I will use an HX711 chip for the load cell. Tomorrow, I need to find the exact measurements of the cell for the box. I also created a schematic diagram and moved some parts to the back of the PCB. Tomorrow, I have to wire the PCB and perhaps create the BOM on GitHub. Overall, I am really happy with today's progress.

# Day 4 (July 1st): Finished PCB (hopefully)
I was really busy today. I added a fourth switch and wired the PCB.

I also started the 3D modelling of the box and went to a local building centre to look at the prices of screws.

I am also quite confident with my selected parts. A boom will follow shortly. 

**Time spent: 12h**

# Day 5 (July 2nd): PCB-Housing
On day 5, I mainly worked on the PCB housing for the box. I created screw holders and a front plate for installation, as well as cut-outs for components and the hall effect sensor.

# Day 6 (July 3nd): Closing-Mechanism
Today I started creating the closing mechanism. First I added the housing for the servo motor.

Afterwards I started creating the gear system.

**Time spent: 2h**

# Day 7 (July 5nd): Closing-Mechanism
Today I made a lot of progress. I added motion to the gear and a gear cover to hold the servo.

Afterwards I created the distance holder for the load cell as well as a model of the laod cell and the inner box that carries the weight.

# Day 8 (July 6nd): Closing-Mechanism
Today I added a Box cover with some hinges.

Then I added the final part to close the box.

Afterwards I made the hole for the wireless charger.

I also had to add a lot of details with regard to spacing, which was really time-consuming.
**Time spent: 10h**

# Day 9 (July 17nd): Final
I forgot that the screws would stick out a little, so I made a hole for them with covers.

There were also some other minor improvements that are not worth mentioning.
Besides that, I spent most of the time working on all the files to submit the project finally. ðŸŽ†
