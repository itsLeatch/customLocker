# Day 1 (June 9th): Familiarize yourself with fusion 360
Today I created an education account for fusion 360 and installed the application as well. In addition to that, I familiarized myself with the program by building a lego brick from an tuturial.

# Day 2 (June 12th): First steps in KiCad
Today I installed KiCad and followed the tutorial from [Hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide). I also decided for the [ESP32-32D](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4000093185394.html?spm=a2g0o.store_pc_home.productList_2007716161325.4000093185394&gatewayAdapt=glo2deu), added the three-pin connector for the servo and I was looking for a screen. However I am still unsure about the measurements of the footprint.
